Rock, paper, scissors
=====================

Two years ago, when asked to make a rock, paper, scissors (RPS) game using Python, I wrote a nobrain (to me) [version](old_rps.py).

Today, I came across a much more elegant method, inspired by [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/nf9920/how_can_you_turn_a_rock_paper_scissor_code_as_a/gyk8xlw), which I rewrote as [rps.py](rps.py).
